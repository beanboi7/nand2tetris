# About
This repository consists of the solutions to the Nand2Tetris course on Coursera.
<br>
- Week 1 to Week 6 is the first part of this 2 Course series.
- Consists of `Computational chips, Sequential chips, ALU, RAM, ROM, CPU` and a fully functional `Computer` chip made from these elements which all started out from the humble `NAND` gate.
- Finally, at the end of Nand2Tetris-1 a fully functional assembler written in `Python` that translates files written in `.asm` to `.hack` machine language is developed. 
- Nand2Tetris-2 in progress.

### ToDo
- [ ] Better documentation of the week 5 resources.
- [ ] Complete Nand2Tetris-2 and update.
