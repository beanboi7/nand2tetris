# About
This repository consists of the solutions to the Nand2Tetris course on Coursera.

- Week 1 to Week 6 is the first part of this 2 Course series.
- Consists of `Computational chips, Sequential chips, ALU, RAM, ROM, CPU` and a fully functional `Computer` chip made from these elements.
- Finally, a fully functional assembler written in `Python` that translates .asm to .hack machine language is developed at the end of Nand2Tetris-1.
- Nand2Tetris-2 in progress.

### ToDo
- [ ] Better documentation of the week 5 resources.
